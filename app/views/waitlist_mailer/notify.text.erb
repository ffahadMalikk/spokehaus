Hey <%= @user.name %>,

A spot on the waitlist you are on has opened up!

You can claim the spot here:

<%= new_scheduled_class_booking_url(@waitlist_entry.scheduled_class) %>

Act quickly: There were people before you on the waitlist that were notified
who are still able to accept this spot. After a period of time, people after
you will be notified and they can accept the spot as well.

See you on the bike!
