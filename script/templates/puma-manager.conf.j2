# /etc/init/puma-manager.conf - manage a set of Pumas

# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple Puma instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See puma.conf for how to manage a single Puma instance.
#
# Use "stop puma-manager" to stop all Puma instances.
# Use "start puma-manager" to start all instances.
# Use "restart puma-manager" to restart all instances.
# Crazy, right?
